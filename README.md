Last I checked, this doesn't work; some functions might still be functional, 
but not the code you're looking to copy. 
The unobfuscated code is in VaserSource.lua.

Vaser is a Script for Roblox SharkBite 2

play it here https://www.roblox.com/games/8908228901/WILDFIRE-SharkBite-2

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cienceTM/Vaser/main/src/Vaser.lua",true))()
